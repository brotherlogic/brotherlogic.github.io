Milestone 1 is meant to be simple but it's a stepping stone to building out what the discography will look like.
So that means I want to (a) get a list of every Fall release (including each version of each release) and (b)
I define full ownership as owning every release.

So that's very wrong since no-one would do that, but it gives us enough to start to build the infrastructure for
where we want to be. Plus owning everything is something of a legit goal for some folks so maybe there's a value
in saying I own e.g. 20% of everything ever released by The Fall.

To get this milestone I need to:
  *  Build a list of all Fall releases
  *  Decide on how to represent that in a database and populate said database
  *  Build out the basic website scaffolding
  *  Add in login and auth to the website
  *  Do the overlap calc on the logged in user and display it


So that's what I'm going to try and get done this week.
